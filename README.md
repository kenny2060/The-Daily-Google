### What is this?
This is a submisson for the [Google Nanodegree Front End Web Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011). These are the prerequisites which were required to complete this project:
- Webserver - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Web application framework for routing - [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- Build tool - [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Using webpack, we will set up the app to have dev and prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
- External script - [Service Worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers)
- External API - [Aylien](https://newsapi.aylien.com/)

### Deployment
---
Start up the server with `index.js`, located in the `/server` folder (Command line - `npm run start`). Once started, on the `Localhost:8081`, you'll then see the website Homepage.
Type anything you would like too search in the News, from anywhere in the whole world. For example, enter something like... "Trump".
Sit back, let the Channel 4 News Team do their thing. You're so wise. You're like a miniature Buddha, covered in hair.
